# rnaML2

## Research Project at University of North Georgia under Dr. Mohammad Mohebbi

This version creates images from nucleotide strand pairing information out of Java

- The images are split into two categories which are either "hit" or "miss"

- Images may be found in the src/lib folder as 'targetFind.png' and 'targetMiss.png'

- These images will be passed into a Convolutional Neural Network (along with their labels) using Python to determine patterns and predict whether validation/test microRNA strands will bind to larger mRNA strands

- Goal for the future is to be set up a working system where a user may type or scan in the microRNA and mRNA nucleotide sequences and run the model on a browser that will then give a confidence interval for the binding probabilty
